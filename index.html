        <p>My name is Om and I love trekking, I like adventures not any but a good one. It should be a bit difficult and exciting. Yes am talking about trekking. I like trekking because of nature around and you can view the city/village/town from the height which is breathtaking. Also it is one the best form of exercise.

        <p>I have only done two treks till now but I can go after the pademic situation. My first trek was to a place named Karnala. The second was to Shivneri. Althogh Shivneri was at higher altitudes it was that way easy to climb than Karnala.  When we were near Karnala, the top looked like a thumb. Where as for Shivneri we could not see the top because of the trees and Shivneri's height.</p>

         <p>If you have seen people trekking and looks as if it is easy then it's not like that. Trekking is difficult. Not that difficult but it depends apon how old he fort or whatever you are climbing. If the fort is very old then there is a chance that you can slip and fall so you have to take extra care. The first trek of mine was in my second std and the second in third std.</p>
